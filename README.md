genre-ha! is a webapp made specifically for genre-nerds like me. All you have to do is think of a genre you know and love, type it into the search bar and hit submit and you'll instantly get a random artist from that genre. It can range from the most popular of the medium to the most obscure. You might even find artists from around the world! You can get as in-depth as you want with the genres.

Obscure suggestions to try: Blackened doom, noise-folk, cloud rap
